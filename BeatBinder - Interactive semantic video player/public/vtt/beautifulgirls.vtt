00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900
Damn all these beautiful girls

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.900
They only wanna do you dirt

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.900
They'll have you suicidal suicidal

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.900
When they say it's over

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.900
("Beautiful Girls" by Sean Kingston)

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.900
JR! Sean Kingston!

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.900
You're way too beautiful girl

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.900
That's why it'll never work

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.900
You have me suicidal suicidal

10
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.900
When you say it's over

11
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.900
Damn all these beautiful girls

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.900
They only wanna do you dirt

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.900
They'll have you suicidal suicidal

14
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.900
When they say it's over

15
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.900
See it started at the park

16
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.900
Used to chill after dark

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.900
Oh when you took my heart

18
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.900
That's when we fell apart

19
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.900
'Cause we both thought

20
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.900
That love last forever last forever

21
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.900
They say we're too young

22
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.900
To get ourselves sprung

23
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.900
Oh we didn't care

24
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.900
We made it very clear

25
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.900
And they also said

26
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.900
That we couldn't last together last together

27
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.900
See it's very defined

28
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.900
You're one of a kind

29
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.900
But you mash up my mind

30
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.900
You ought to get declined

31
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.900
Oh Lord

32
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.900
My baby is driving me crazy

33
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.900
You're way too beautiful girl

34
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.900
That's why it'll never work

35
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.900
You have me suicidal suicidal

36
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.900
When you say it's over

37
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.900
Damn all these beautiful girls

38
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.900
They only wanna do you dirt

39
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.900
They'll have you suicidal suicidal

40
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.900
When they say it's over

41
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.900
It was back in '99

42
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.900
Watchin' movies all the time

43
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.900
Oh when I went away

44
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.900
For doin' my first crime

45
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.900
And I never thought

46
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.900
That we was gonna see each other see each other

47
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.900
And then I came out

48
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.900
Mami moved me down south

49
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.900
Oh I'm with my girl

50
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.900
Who I thought was my world

51
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.900
It came out to be

52
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.900
That she wasn't the girl for me girl for me

53
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.900
See it's very defined

54
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.900
You're one of a kind

55
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.900
But you mash up my mind

56
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.900
You have to get declined

57
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.900
Oh Lord

58
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.900
My baby is driving me crazy

59
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.900
You're way too beautiful girl

60
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.900

Now we're fussin'

Please tell me why

And I don't know

72
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.900
How to make it better make it better

73

What I'm seein' with my eyes

77
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.900
I'm losin' my mind
